<h1>how do you sort a dictionary by key in python</h1><pre>You can sort a dictionary by key in Python using the `sorted()` function with the dictionary's `keys()` method as shown below:

```
# Define a dictionary
my_dict = {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 5}

# Sort the keys of the dictionary
sorted_keys = sorted(my_dict.keys())

# Loop through the sorted keys and print the corresponding values
for key in sorted_keys:
    print(key, my_dict[key])
```

This will output the key-value pairs of the dictionary in alphabetical order of keys:

```
apple 3
banana 2
cherry 5

1. Use the `def` keyword followed by the function name to define your function.
2. Inside the parentheses, you can specify any parameters that your function takes. If it takes no parameters, you can leave the parentheses empty.
3. End the first line of your function definition with a colon `:`.
4. Write the body of your function indented by four spaces (or one tab). This is where you include the code that you want your function to execute.
5. Optionally, you can use the `return` keyword to specify the value that your function should return.

Here's an example of a simple Python function that takes two integers and returns their sum:

```
def add_numbers(x, y):
    result = x + y
    return result
```

In this example, the function is called `add_numbers` and takes two parameters (`x` and `y`). The body of the function calculates the sum of `x` and `y`, stores the result in a variable named `result`, and then returns the value of `result`.</pre><h1>how many positions in the kama sutra</h1><pre>This is not a coding question.</pre>
